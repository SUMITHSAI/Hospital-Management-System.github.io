 ## GETTING INTO THE PROJECT:
This Hospital Management System built with php and mysql provides a comprehensive platform to streamline various hospital operations. The ‚ÄòHome‚Äô page integrates multiple sections, including Logins, Services, About Us, Contact Us, and Gallery, to offer an intuitive and seamless user experience. Fig 1.1 illustrates the dynamic and user-friendly interface of the 'Home' page in our project.

The ‚ÄòHome‚Äô page consists of 3 Logins:
1. Patient Login
2. Doctor Login
3. Admin Login

Working Demo
### Patient Login:

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This login module allows patients to create their account, book an appointment to see a doctor and see their appointment history.
  The registration page asks patients to enter their First Name, Last Name, Email ID, Contact Number, Password and radio buttons to select their gender.
  
![](https://github.com/SUMITHSAI/Hospital-Management-System.github.io/blob/main/Hospital-Management-System-PHP/hospital/assets/HMS%20Working%20Demo/11.png)

Once the patient has created his/her own account after clicking the ‚ÄòRegister‚Äô button, then he will be regustered and can login to his/her Dashboard(Fig 1.8).

<div align="center">
  **Fig 1.6: Dashboard**
</div>

### Doctor Login:

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The doctors can login into their account which can be done by toggling the tab from ‚ÄòPatient‚Äô to ‚ÄòDoctor‚Äô. Fig 1.1 shows the login form for a doctor. Registration of a doctor account can be done only by admin. We will discuss more about this in Admin Module.
  
![](https://github.com/SUMITHSAI/Hospital-Management-System.github.io/blob/main/Hospital-Management-System-PHP/hospital/assets/HMS%20Working%20Demo/9.png)

### Admin Module:
   
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This module is the heart of our project where an admin can see the list of all patients. Doctors and appointments and the feedback/queries received from the ‚ÄòContact‚Äô page. Also admin can add doctor too. 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Login into admin account can be done by toggling into admin tab of the Home page. Fig 1.1 shows login to admin tab.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `username`: admin, `password`: admin123

### Pateint Dashboard
The Patient Dashboard page allows patients to perform three operations:

**1. Book his/her appointment:**

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, the patients can able to book their appointments to see a doctor. The appointment form(Fig 1.6) requires patients to select the doctor that they want to see, Date and Time that they want to meet with the doctor. The consultancy fee will be shown accordingly to the patient as it was already determined by the doctor.

![](https://github.com/SUMITHSAI/Hospital-Management-System.github.io/blob/main/Hospital-Management-System-PHP/hospital/assets/HMS%20Working%20Demo/14.png)

After clicking on the ‚ÄòSubmit‚Äô button, the patient will receive an alert that acknowledges the successful appointment of the patient. 

![](https://github.com/SUMITHSAI/Hospital-Management-System.github.io/blob/main/Hospital-Management-System-PHP/hospital/assets/HMS%20Working%20Demo/15.png)

**2. View patients Appointment History:**

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, the patient can see their appointment history which contains Doctor Name, Consultancy Fee, Appointment Date and Time.(See Fig 1.8).
	
![](https://github.com/SUMITHSAI/Hospital-Management-System.github.io/blob/main/Hospital-Management-System-PHP/hospital/assets/HMS%20Working%20Demo/16.png)
<div align="center">
  **Fig 1.6: Appointment History**
</div>

Once the patient has logged out of his account, if he wants to go into his account again, he can login his account, instead of register his account again. Fig 1.9 shows the login page.
Clicking on ‚ÄòLogin‚Äô button will redirect the patient to his dashboard page which we have seen earlier (Fig 1.8)

This is how the patient module works. On the whole, this module allows patients to register their account or login their account(if he/she has one), book an appointment and view his/her appointment history.

**3. View and Update Patient(User) Profile**

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the patient profile, patients can view and update their profiles, which include details such as username, address, city, gender, and email. This information allows for personalized and efficient healthcare services. 

![](https://github.com/SUMITHSAI/Hospital-Management-System.github.io/blob/main/Hospital-Management-System-PHP/hospital/assets/HMS%20Working%20Demo/13.png)

<div align="center">
  **Fig 1.6: Dashboard**
</div>


- After logging out of their account, patients can easily log back in without needing to register again. Fig 1.6 illustrates the login page where users can enter their credentials.

- Once logged in, patients are redirected to their dashboard (Fig 1.8), where they can access various features, including viewing and updating their profiles, booking appointments, and viewing appointment history.

- On the whole, this module provides patients with the convenience of managing their profiles, booking appointments, and accessing their healthcare information seamlessly.
